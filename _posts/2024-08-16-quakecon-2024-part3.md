Wednesday had one item on the agenda: LineCon®.  We slept in a bit to make sure that if things went super late like last year we didn't have to worry about powering through exhaustion to get checked in.  Thankfully that wasn't an issue, but we started the day with a final check of our LAN rigs to make sure everything was good to go, which really just consisted of ensuring our games were up to date.  We checked the gear for damage the day after we arrived in Texas, and nothing got so much as a scratch on it.  No component failures either.  So with everything ready to go, we relaxed for the afternoon in front of the TV and kept an eye on the QuakeCon Discord for updates on the line length.  The goal was to arrive late enough that we wouldn't be spending the entire day in the same spot, but not so late that the line would be out the front door of the Gaylord (which it always is).  Gotta stay in that glorious air conditioning.

When we got word that the line was starting to enter the main atrium of the Gaylord we headed out, arriving just after 5PM.  I decided to snap a few photos on the way in since my phone camera took respectable photos again.

Given the hour I was actually expecting more of the atrium to be filled, but we actually made it most of the way through the atrium before we found the end of the line.  With that pleasant surprise we parked our gear and waited to see if any familiar faces popped up either in front of or behind us.

The next pleasant surprise was we waited in line all of maybe five or so minutes before the line started moving.  Check-in had begun!  *Massive* improvement over last year!  It still took nearly two hours to reach security checkpoints, but I think this was a record for line movement speed.

I was disappointed that the Q-lamps weren't present at the fountain leading to the convention center this year.  Not sure what that's all about.  It's a small thing, but if you also noticed the lack of QuakeCon signs in the train photos, the absence of these little details was a touch disappointing.  Hopefully we'll see their return next year.

The hallway leading to the convention center had another surprise.  Apparently the Chili's general managers convention was held that same week, though I don't know which dates, and they didn't take down their banners.  How dare they encroach on QuakeCon?!  The FedEx business office is considered one of the landmarks for LineCon® since it's next to the seatbelt maze lines and the metal detectors.  The secondary Pecos Pete's kiosk out here was nice because we didn't have to wait until the next day to get mugs and a drink.  Gotta stay hydrated! :P

It took us roughly thirty minutes to reach this point, but getting through the final lines and the metal detectors took almost ninety more minutes.  Not unexpected and I didn't notice any unpleasant surprises on the other side of security.  Though that said, this is always the slowest part of LineCon® because gear check-in is a slow process.  It's definitely been streamlined over the years, but it still takes time.  I'm a patient man though, and having been through this process before I know what to expect, and more importantly I know that it's always worth it.  On the flip side though, this year we brought monitors so no waiting in a second line for rentals. :)

The gear check-in process was the same as last year: provide ID, get your photo taken, barcodes placed on main components, and then it's on to badge pickup.  With that completed it was time to get excited.  Hello BYOC!!!

I didn't get any more photos after this because the official name for gear check-in "Drop-and-go" is aptly named.  You need to find your place, drop and unpack your gear, and then go.  You can't loiter or anything, which includes taking photos.  No biggie, a pile of three not-yet-assembled LAN rigs and cables on a table isn't exactly photo worthy.

It was about 7:45PM when we left the BYOC.  We were starving at this point and being on hard floors for three hours straight put in the mood to head back to the hotel, get off our feet, and eat in, which is exactly what we did before turning in for the night.  Definitely no regrets getting a two-room king suite with a kitchenette.  Seriously, not only was this $45/night cheaper than a standard room at the Gaylord, we could cook in the room instead of going out or ordering room service for every meal.  Legit convention protip right there.

Today: LineCon®.  Tomorrow: QuakeCon.  That is all.
