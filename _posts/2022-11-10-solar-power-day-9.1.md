Considering only about twenty minutes of work needed to be performed today, I'm not even calling this its own day. One pergola crewmember came back to screw in the remaining black lag bolts on the south side of the pergola since they didn't have quite enough lags and washers on hand yesterday. But technically now Phase 1 is truly complete.

On the solar side of things it seems like we are waiting for some finances to clear.  Some of the electrical work to wire up the pergola, as well as the roof construction, are added costs that weren't covered in our original loan, so once that happens the solar crew should be back and ready to go.  I'm also told that we got an extension on the loan (for how long I don't know) which is enough to get everyone out of panic mode.  My best guess is that the financial side of things will be completed on Monday and then the crew would return on Tuesday.  Time to play the waiting game, but as much as I was looking forward to this all being done sooner, a few days' break from the last two weeks is actually a welcome reprieve for my energy levels.

In the meantime, back to the day job. Be back soon.
